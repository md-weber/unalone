# Unalone
An app that should help the society to find more friends in their lives.

## The idea
This is a placeholder repository where I want to collect ideas on how to solve or at least 
ease a problem in our society that I hear more and more about. The problem I am talking about is
lonelyness and disconnection. After I watched some videos from Moon a great YouTuber that 
shows how damaging certain social media can be for our brain I asked the question on Twitter.

> [Do you think you have enough real life friends?](https://twitter.com/flutter_exp/status/1539702796529926145)

In my opinion the result of the survey shows that not everyone is directly effected but a lot of people
would love to have more and deeper connections as friends. Personally I believe our society has lost some
basic skills in that direction. 

Vision of this app / website whatever it will be:
> Enable every single human to find one or more friends.

## How should that be possible?
Great question and honestly, I do not know yet. Some basic ideas would be like a Tinder or Facebook which let
you connect to people around you and plan activities. It should give tipps and tricks how to be a good friend
ideas on how to improve friendship. 

To help society to learn again what friendship is all about, it sounds a bit like a weird child book or something a diety
religion should solve, but I believe that this could be something that helps our society and me personally because also
myself feels sometimes lost.

## Contribution
It would be great if this would be a community effort so please feel free to support this project by:
- Adding your ideas as Issues in this repository
- Knowledge or skills in ethics, psychology or relevant skills
- Ideas on how to achieve that goal (What would you personally move outside and meet other people?)
